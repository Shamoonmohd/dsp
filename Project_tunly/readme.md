# tun.ly


tun.ly is a simple software that identifies the genre of a audio clip played. 
The identification is done by calculating the audio profile of the sound and comparing it with the audio profiles already saved in the program.
The audio profile is made with signal processing concepts such as [STFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform)( short time fourier transform) and filters.
This software is made in collab with :
